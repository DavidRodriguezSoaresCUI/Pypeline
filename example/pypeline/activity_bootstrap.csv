# Activity bootstrap
# ==================
#
# Empty rows and anything written after a # character will be ignored
#
# This configuration file must contain an entry for each activity activity type,
# worker that may bootstrap process them, and optionally the data to put in the
# activity file.
#
# The macro $PYPELINE_DIR is available in the activityData field to inject
# the root directory of activities.
